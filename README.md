# Calculator. (+unittest)

Basic calculator with operations like (+.-.*,/). Used unittest to check programm. So this is my first unittest, that I written yourself.

## Installation

You don't need any libraries to install, because itâ€™s already built into python library.

So you need to use Testcase(class) from unittest

```python
from unittest import TestCase
```

## Usage

```python

# returns '4'
calculator('2+2')

# returns '1'
calculator('10-9')

# returns '10'
calculator('2*5')

# returns '2.0'
calculator('100/50')
```
